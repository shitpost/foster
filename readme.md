### set up this project on your computer

- [download & setup](https://www.renpy.org/doc/html/quickstart.html#the-ren-py-launcher) renpy

- [download git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), and a git GUI client

- go into whatever folder you want the project to live in. use the git GUI client to "clone" this project into that folder

- open renpy and edit the preferences and update the project folder so renpy can find the project (you might need to click "refresh")


This was horribly confusing so please contact [daiyi](https://twitter.com/daiyitastic) if you have any questions! <3
